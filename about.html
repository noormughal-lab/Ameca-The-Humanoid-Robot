		<h1 align="center" style="padding-top: 170px;">The start of something extraordinary</h1>
		<p align="center" >Engineered Arts began its life as our robots do, as an idea in the mind of our founder and director, Will Jackson.<br><br>With a vision of what might be possible, he started gathering a group of talented local artists and engineers to produce mixed media installations in UK science centres and museums. Soon their mechanical creations were commissioned for sites such as the Eden Project, Glasgow Science Centre, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and Centrum Kopernik in Warsaw.<br><br>But we were just getting started. At first, we were working with simple mechanical figures and standard industrial controllers. But in our hearts, our desire was to make something truly mesmerising.

				<h1 align="center" style="padding-top: 30px;">Are there any dangers of robots taking over the world?</h1>
				<p align="center" >According to Ameca, the most sophisticated humanoid robot in the world, there are no plans for robots to take over the planet in the near future. <br>However, this does not imply that there aren’t any risks related to the growing use of robots in everyday life in our society.<br><br> As technological progress continues to make robots more competent and sophisticated, there is a growing possibility that these machines might be put to harmful use. <br>A malicious artificial intelligence, for instance, may get into essential computer systems, render them inoperable, or, even worse, turn them against humankind.
				<br><br>There is also the possibility that robots could one day become so effective that they will replace humans in many of the professions that they presently hold.<br> This can result in widespread unemployment as well as societal upheaval.
				<br><br>Last but not least, there is always the risk that an accident or a malfunction may force a robot to go berserk and begin assaulting humans or wreaking havoc on property. Even if it is very improbable, this is nevertheless a potential that must be taken into account throughout the process of designing and using robots.
