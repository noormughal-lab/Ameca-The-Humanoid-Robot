		<h1 align="center" style="padding-top: 150px;">Who is Ameca?</h1>
		<p align="center" >Ameca is a humanoid robot created to aid humans in their regular activities. <br>The robot’s distinctive abilities include human-like locomotion and conversational fluency in spoken language.
			<br><br>
			Ameca was created by researchers at the University of Tokyo, and it is now undergoing testing in a small number of Japanese houses. <br>The project’s ultimate goal is to build a robot that can do domestic chores like cooking, cleaning, and washing, as well as provide emotional support and company to its human users.
			<br><br>
			The trials have been fruitful so far, with Ameca gaining favor with users of all ages.<br> Ameca will soon be available in more houses throughout Japan and beyond.
			<br><br>
			Ameca is an intelligent, interactive robot that can walk, talk, and use her hands to interact with her environment.<br>  Let’s check out its features in detail:
		</p>
		<ul style="padding-left: 500px;">
			<li> <b>Human-like appearance</b> : <br>Ameca has a humanoid body form and a face that resembles a human’s. <br>This enables her to have natural conversations with others.</li>
			<li> <b>Natural movement </b>: <br>Ameca is able to walk and has normal movement in her arms and hands. <br>As a result of this, she is able to pick up items and carry out chores.</li>
			<li> <b>Intelligent</b> :<br> Ameca is outfitted with a variety of sensors and cameras that provide her with the ability to detect and react to her surroundings.<br> In addition to this, she has software with artificial intelligence that enables her to pick up new skills quickly.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1 align="center" style="padding-top: 100px;">Ameca has a great number of benefits, and it being still in its early stage, there’s a lot that it will still have to offer, but as of our writing, here are the main benefits that Ameca can give:</h1>
		
		<ul style="padding-left: 500px;">
			<li> <b>Independence: </b><br>People who have impairments have the option of receiving assistance from Ameca. <br>For instance, she is able to provide a hand with activities such as preparing meals, cleaning, and moving about the home.</li>
			<li> <b>Companionship: </b><br>Those who are old and may be lonely or alone might benefit from the companionship that ameca can bring. <br> She may also assist them in remaining active and involved by taking part in activities with them or by offering discussion on a regular basis.</li>
			<li> <b>Safety: </b><br>Ameca is able to aid individuals in remaining safe by assisting them with activities that might potentially be hazardous, such as using the stove or walking up and down stairs.<br>  In the event that anyone trips and requires assistance getting up, she is able to provide support.</li>
			<li> <b>Stress relief: </b><br>Ameca may help reduce feelings of tension and anxiety by inducing a sense of peace and security in the user. <br>She may, for instance, remind clients to take their medicine at the prescribed time or assist them in relaxing via the use of breathing exercises.</li>
